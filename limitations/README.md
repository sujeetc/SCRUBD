# Limitations of Existing Datasets

The `limitations/` folder explores the limitations in existing smart contract datasets and provides additional insight into how vulnerabilities are represented and detected. This folder contains a single subfolder called `Turn-The-Rudder`, which provides an analysis of **semantically unique** and **exact matches** between vulnerable and non-vulnerable smart contract functions.

## Folder Structure

### `Turn-The-Rudder/`
#### Zibin Zheng, Neng Zhang, Jianzhong Su, Zhijie Zhong, Mingxi Ye, and Jiachi Chen. 2023. Turn the Rudder: A Beacon of Reentrancy Detection for Smart Contracts on Ethereum. In Proceedings of the 45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '23). IEEE Press, 295â€“306. [DOI: 10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00036](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00036)

This folder contains three CSV files that highlight different levels of function similarities in smart contracts, focusing on vulnerabilities:

- **`duplicates-semantically-unique.csv`**: This file lists smart contract functions that are semantically unique but may contain duplicate or similar-looking code.

- **`duplicates-unique.csv`**: This file contains a list of unique functions from `duplicates.csv`.

- **`duplicates.csv`**: This file lists completely identical functions found in different smart contracts. These duplicates share both the same function names and bodies.

Each file contains the following columns:

- **`Smart Contract`**: The name of the smart contract where the function appears.
  
- **`Vuln-Function`**: The name of the function that is considered vulnerable in the contract.

- **`Exact-Function-In-Non-Vuln`**: A hash of the function body that has been matched with a non-vulnerable function in a different contract. This column shows cases where a function is vulnerable in one contract but matches exactly with a non-vulnerable version in another contract. The format of this field is:

<hash-of-function-body>,<SmartContractAddress>-<FunctionName>,<SmartContractAddress>-<FunctionName>

Each file contains columns for the smart contract name, the vulnerable function, and an exact match of the function in a non-vulnerable contract. The 'Exact-Function-In-Non-Vuln' column includes a hash followed by a list of contract addresses and corresponding function names that represent matched non-vulnerable functions.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `Turn-The-Rudder/` folder.
2. Open any of the CSV files to analyze the relationship between vulnerable functions and their counterparts in non-vulnerable contracts.
3. Use the data to study how certain vulnerabilities may propagate even when function names appear identical or similar.

### Example Workflow:

You can load the CSV files into a data analysis tool like pandas in Python to process and analyze the data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('Turn-The-Rudder/duplicates-semantically-unique.csv')

# Display the data
print(df.head())
